Please create a full web application that generates ZX Spectrum–style loading screens from user text prompts. The app should be built in React + TypeScript, and should use both Gemini and Imagen.

App requirements:
🎨 Image Generation (Imagen)

The user enters a text description.

Gemini rewrites the description into a style appropriate for classic ZX Spectrum loading screens (e.g., 1980s UK home computer game art).

Imagen generates an image using only the ZX Spectrum 15-colour palette:

ZX Spectrum palette:

Black (#000000)

Blue (#0000D7)

Red (#D70000)

Magenta (#D700D7)

Green (#00D700)

Cyan (#00D7D7)

Yellow (#D7D700)

White (#FFFFFF)
(and their BRIGHT variants)

Bright Blue (#0000FF)

Bright Red (#FF0000)

Bright Magenta (#FF00FF)

Bright Green (#00FF00)

Bright Cyan (#00FFFF)

Bright Yellow (#FFFF00)

Bright White (#FFFFFF)

The app should include post-processing logic so that any generated image is quantised down to the exact ZX Spectrum palette (no gradients or colours outside this list).

🖥️ Output style

The final image should mimic a Spectrum loading screen:

Chunky pixel aesthetic

Slight RGB bleed optional

Optional horizontal loading-stripe effect at the bottom

Resolution around 256 × 192 scaled up cleanly for display

No modern digital shading or anti-aliasing

🧠 Gemini usage

Use Gemini to:

Rewrite prompts into ZX Spectrum visual-description style

Ensure the generation prompt always mentions the 15-colour palette

Optionally emulate 80s UK game themes (e.g., Ultimate Play the Game, Ocean, Imagine, Mikro-Gen)

💾 App behaviour

The app should include:

A text box for the user’s description

A “Generate Loading Screen” button

A preview of the generated ZX Spectrum image

A “Download image” button

A simple, retro-styled UI (80s micro feel)

🔒 API & security

Use the Gemini and Imagen APIs correctly

Keep API keys secure on the backend

Do not expose any credentials in client code

📦 Deployable

The application should be fully deployable via Google Cloud Run using the "Deploy" option in AI Studio.

If possible, please also generate a small set of example Speccy prompts like:

“Knight exploring a haunted forest”

“Starfighter escaping an alien base”

“Footballer celebrating a last-minute cup winner”
